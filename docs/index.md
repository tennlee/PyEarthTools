# PyEarthTools: Machine learning for Earth system science

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/903938118.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15760768)

- An approachable way for researchers to get started with ML research for Earth system science
- Provides a software framework for research and experimentation
- Also suitable for students and newcomers
- Still under early-stage development - things are likely to change a lot. If you notice an issue, please feel free to raise it on GitHub

## Installation

**Here is the quickest way to install the complete framework and get started:**

We strongly recommend using either a Conda or Python [virtual environment](installation.md#virtual-environments).

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Conda environment
Run the following commands to install PyEarthTools in a Conda environment:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
conda create -y -p ./venv python graphviz
conda activate ./venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```
::::
::::{tab-item} Python virtual environment
Run the following commands to install PyEarthTools in a Python virtual environment:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which may be installed and used separately. See the [installation guide](installation.md) for more details.

## Overview of PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools is a Python framework containing modules for:
 - loading and fetching data;
 - pre-processing, normalising and standardising data into a normal form suitable for machine learning;
 - defining machine learning (ML) models;
 - training ML models and managing experiments;
 - performing inference with ML models;
 - and evaluating ML models (coming soon).

## Overview of the Packages within PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which can be used individually or together.

|    Sub-Package                                         |  Purpose  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------- |
|  [Data](api/data/data_index.md)                        | Loading and indexing Earth system data into xarray |
|  [Utils](api/utils/utils_index.md)                     | Code for common functionality across the sub-packages |
|  [Pipeline](api/pipeline/pipeline_index.md)            | Process and normalise Earth system data ready for machine learning |
|  [Training](api/training/training_index)               | Training processes for machine learning modelsl |
|  [Tutorial](api/tutorial/tutorial_index.md)            | Contains helper code for data sets used in tutorials |
|  [Bundled Models](api/bundled_models/bundled_index.md) | Maintained versions of specific, bundled models which can be easily trained and run |
|  [Zoo](api/zoo/zoo_index.md)                           | Contains code for managing registered models (such as the bundled models) |
|  Evaluation                                            | (Coming soon) Contains code for producing standard evaluations (such as benchmarks and scorecards) |
